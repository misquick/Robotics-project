# Autonomous Trash Can on Tracks

## Project Description
The **Autonomous Trash Can on Tracks** is a robotics project aimed at creating a mobile, Arduino-powered trash can that navigates autonomously and can be stopped manually for garbage loading. This project showcases how Arduino systems can be used in practical applications to improve convenience and efficiency.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore the potential of integrating robotics into everyday tasks. By developing a prototype, the project demonstrates basic automation principles and highlights areas for improvement and scalability in industrial applications.

## Outcomes
- **Achievements:**
  - Built a functional tracked platform with a mounted trash can.
  - Implemented a manual stop function for user control.
  - Achieved basic autonomous navigation along predefined paths.
- **Limitations:**
  - Limited obstacle avoidance capabilities.
  - User interface needs enhancements for better usability.
  - Scalability for industrial use remains unexplored.

## Setup Instructions
1. In this repository use **code** file, which contains the code for the arduino
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the code.
3. Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram in the [TinkerCad chematics](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ednUKXVoeb4-robotics-project).
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- Tracked platform with DC motors
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Trash can or box
- Power supply (battery pack)

## Usage Instructions
1. Assemble the hardware components following the instructions.
2. Turn on the power supply.
3. Place the trash can on the platform.
4. Use your hand to stop the trash can as needed for garbage loading.

## Replication
To replicate this project:
- Gather the hardware components listed in the requirements.
- Setup instructions to assemble and program the system:
  1. Assemble the platform with tracks or wheels, with 2 DC motors.
  2. Combine **Arduino Uno** with the **Motor driver shield** to control the motors.
  3. 3D print the holder for the ultrasonic sensor.
  4. Connect everything according to the scheme
  5. Install the trash box or container on the platform.
  6. Upload the code to the Arduino Uno through the IDE.
  7. If everything is right the robot will be ready to work.
- Test the system in an environment if needed.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate ultrasonic or infrared sensors for obstacle detection and avoidance.
- Develop a mobile app for intuitive control.
- Upgrade hardware for better reliability and scalability.
- Investigate renewable energy options, such as solar power, for sustainable operation.
